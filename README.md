# Access to Financial Markets
### Task
This project studies a key question in emerging economies: how do households differ in their access to financial markets?
I study this using household data from Mexico.

My findings:
1. Households with high levels of education are more likely to have access to financial markets.
2. Households with higher levels of income are more likely to have access to financial markets.


### Data
Household data from [Mexican Family Life Survey](http://www.ennvih-mxfls.org/english/)

### Data Wrangling
1. Imputed missing income values using regression
2. Merged individual level and household level datasets
3. Removed income outliers

### Tools
1. Pandas - data wrangling
2. Matplotlib/seaborn - visualization
3. Statsmodels - logistic regression
